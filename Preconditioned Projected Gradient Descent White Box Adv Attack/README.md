# PGD-pytorch
**A pytorch implementation of "[Towards Deep Learning Models Resistant to Adversarial Attacks](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.06083)"**

## Summary
This code is a pytorch implementation of **PGD attack**   
In this code, I used above methods to fool [Inception v3](https://arxiv.org/abs/1512.00567).   
'[Giant Panda](http://www.image-net.org/)' used for an example.   
You can add other pictures with a folder with the label name in the 'data/imagenet'.    

## Requirements
* python==3.6   
* numpy==1.14.2   
* pytorch==1.0.1   

## Important results not in the code
- Capacity(size of network) plays an important role in adversarial training. (p.9-10)
	- For only natural examples training, it increases the robustness against one-step perturbations.
	- For PGD adversarial training, small capacity networks fails.
	- As capacity increases, the model can fit the adversairal examples increasingly well.
	- More capacity and strong adversaries decrease transferability. (Section B)
- FGSM adversaries don't increase robustness for large epsilon(=8). (p.9-10)
	- The network overfit to FGSM adversarial examples.
- Adversarial training with PGD shows good enough defense results.(p.12-13)
